Presentation
============

**RESThub** is a stack based on **Spring** and **Backbone.js** designed to build **HTML5** applications easily and efficiently.
It provides tooling, libraries and documentation in order to build modular web applications with **client side state**, **stateless server** and REST webservices or Websocket communication between both.
